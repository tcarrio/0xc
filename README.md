[Zola] is a static site generator written in Rust which provides the bulk of functionality in this blog. Zola has many themes available, in my case I'm using the [Zola After Dark Theme]. The repository is kept very minimal since I'm utilizing [Git] submodules to reference the external repository.

[GitHub Actions] is utilized for deploying to [GitHub Pages]. The [Zola Deploy Action] provides a simple way to configure CI jobs to execute. In my case, I am able to build for PRs and publish in `main`.

[Nix] makes it simple across systems to quickly start up a shell with a Zola executable in the path and everything else it needs.

## develop

I'm going to assume you're me and have [Nix] and [Direnv] installed because I'm the only real consumer of said repository so if I'm not me then something has gone horribly wrong. Tag along.

```bash
nix develop

# $ Started devshell for 0xc
#
# [0xc]$ ...

zola serve

# Web server is available at http://127.0.0.1:1111...
```

That's it. [Nix] drops you into a shell with all tooling necessary. This repository is pretty lightweight with just `git` and `zola` but the premise applies everywhere. Feel free to check it out!

## Special Thanks

I had been using and had quick success with using the [Zola Deploy Action]. I'm now utilizing this logic but as a Nix package executed via the Nix flake reference. Check out the workflow if you're interested.
