JSON web tokens commonly abbreviated as JWT, are a standard that defines verifiable data payloads and the necessary metadata for that verification. A GWT consists of a header a payload and a signature. That signature can be calculated through a hashing mechanism such as shop 512 or RSA 256 as an example, utilizing the header and payload content. Due to the cryptographic security offered by json web tokens, they are often used for authentication and authorization purposes such as oauth 2.0 and open ID connect.

The header of a json web token defines the type of hashing mechanism. This can be based on HMAC in combination with a common hashing algorithm like Shaw 512 or asymmetric key cryptography such as RSA. The former allows for an opaque secret value to be used for generating the JWT signature which is also used to verify it. The latter utilizes public/private key cryptography that allows you to generate a secret with a private key and utilize a public key, one that can be known by anyone without risking security around the tokens, to verify the signature of the json web token.

The payload of a json web token can contain any valid json object, Jwt's do not have any further intrinsic limitations, but standards that build upon JWTs such as open ID connect use JWTs to provide stateless context in an access or identity token that can be utilized by resource servers or OAuth clients.
